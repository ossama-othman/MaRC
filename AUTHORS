Authors of MaRC -- Map Reprojections and Conversions

Initially written during the Summer of 1995 and currently being maintained by:
Ossama Othman <othman@astrosun.tn.cornell.edu>

Special thanks to Dr. Peter Gierasch and Dr. Don Banfield at the Center for
Radiophysics and Space Research at Cornell University in Ithacs, NY, USA for
helping with all of the nifty coordinate transformations found in MaRC.

Brian Carcich, also at CRSR, helped me find the "in my face" bugs that I
couldn't see since I stared at those code fragements for so long.  He also
helped me better understand some of the geometry which MaRC relies heavily on.
