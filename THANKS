Many thanks to Peter Gierasch, Don Banfield, Maureen Bell and Noam Solomon at
the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research at Cornell University for
putting up with the many bugs they discovered and for helping me refine MaRC
to a point where it is practical and useful.

Additional thanks to Joe Harrington for swamping me with _many_ excellent and
useful suggestions, and for encouraging me to make MaRC open-source.
