3 February 1998
	- Altered "configure.in" to allow users to specify their own
	  CXXFLAGS/CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
	- Distribution of MaRC now follows the terms set forth in the
	  GNU General Public License (GPL) and the GNU Library General Public
	  License (LGPL).
	- Updated TNT headers to TNT version 0.8.5.
	- Cleaned up some of the code so that "PHOTO" type source image
	  routines will only be used when the source image is of type "PHOTO."
	- Updated configure script to use autoconf convention when setting
	  endian symbols.  WORDS_BIGENDIAN is now used instead of LITTLE_ENDIAN
	  to avoid conflicts with system header files such as "endian.h."
	- Added new features:
	  - Averaging technique may be specified in input file.
	  - Sky removal may be shut off for individual input images.
18 November 1997
	- Updated map library version number to 0.7.33.
	- Updated FITS class library.
	- Corrected some code that caused segmentation faults and
	  "pure virtual method called" errors.
	- New coordinate transformations used that correct old coordinate
	  transformation bugs.
	- Enabled "TERMINATOR" keyword in parser and scanner.  Using this
	  keyword with a value of "YES" will force MaRC to avoid mapping
	  data beyond the terminator.  Also added supporting function to
	  boundary code that parser calls when "TERMINATOR" keyword is
	  encountered.
	- Added perspective projection to MaRC. (STILL EXPERIMENTAL)
	- Replaced all (I hope) "zero" pointers with NULL pointers for
	  portability issues.
	- Added image inversion options to input file parser and scanner.
	- Updated weighted average code to use distance from limb in addition
	  to distance from edge of image when computing weights.
	- Corrected bug in boundary computation routine that prevented 360
	  degree visible longitude ranges from being mapped.
	- Updated geometric lens abberration correction routine to check for
	  full frame (800x800) and summation mode frames (400x400).
	- Updated lexer to prevent errors from occurring when reading
	  numbers in scientific notation.
	- Added code to avoid mapping data near limb. (emission angle cut-off)
17 July 1997
	- Updated map library version number to 0.7.17.
	- Averaging procedure changed to use weighted averages.
	- Legal range of extrema is now determined by data type of map.
	  Custom extrema values will be forced to fall within this range.
	- Cleaned up some memory leaks resulting from sloppy "exits." Some
	  memory leaks still exist for some of the "exit" calls.  Eventually,
	  these will be cleaned up.
	- Parser modified to check for the condition of too many planes
	  being specified and/or not enough plane entries in the input file.
	  The below map library change prevents this from occuring when
	  setting up map entries.  As such, this change is redundant, however
	  it does provide the user with better information concerning
	  input file problems.
	- Map library sets the number of planes dynamically now to prevent
	  attempts to write planes that were accidentally added to the
	  number of planes.
	- Added grid routines for the equivalent and conformal projections.
	- Modified parser and lexer to completely support the equivalent
	  and conformal projections.
	- Corrected major bugs in the equivalent and conformal projections.
	  They may still be a little buggy.
30 May 1997
	- Version numbers updated to front end version 0.7.3 and map library
	  version 0.7.7.
	- Memory is now handled very differently.  The new memory scheme
	  uses MUCH less memory for multi-plane maps than previously.  Memory
	  requirements depend ONLY on the number of samples and lines in the
	  desired map.  This means that a map with 20 planes would take up the
	  same amount of memory as a 1 plane map!  Of course, additional
	  memory is still required to handle additional image entries in the
	  image queue, but this memory requirement is insignificant compared
	  to the memory savings of the new memory usage scheme.	
	- Corrected bug in Orthographic class constructor.  Longitudes that
	  were rejected by MaRC that were actually visible will now be
	  accepted.
	- Changed averaging procedure to allow facilitation of new
	  "anti-overflow" buffer.  Negative values may now be mapped on
	  "SHORT" (16-bit) integer maps.
	- MaRC distribution restructured to use GNU autoconf and GNU automake
	  scripts to make untested platform builds more hassle free and to
	  allow easier maintenance of the distribution.
	- FITS library no longer writes extra block before the image extension
	  header.
	- The remaining nine map projections should work now.  MAJOR pointer
	  usage and access bugs were corrected.  Preliminary tests are
	  encouraging.  Grid routines and input file options for them still
	  need to be implemented.
	- Modified boundary routine to allow full incidence angle map to be
	  mapped instead of just what is visible to the observer.
	- Map plot routine has been optimized by using pointer
	  offsets.  This change decreases the number of array offset
	  computations from the 15 within the map loops to only a few.  As a
	  result, there should be a noticeable improvement in speed.
	- HTML documentation now requires texi2html 1.51 or above to build
	  properly due to the new "-monolithic" command line option.  This new
	  option is used to combine the table of contents and main body text
	  into one file.  This new version seems to have corrected inconsistent
	  behavior which occured during the build of HTML version of the
	  concept index.
	- AIPS FITS library may now be compiled with the rest of MaRC
	  instead of seperately.
	- Added the rest of the available maps to the parser and scanner.
	- Added supplementary routines which may be useful for
	  map library users.  Routines include radius of curvature in two
	  directions and distortion at a given planetographic latitude for
	  the conformal maps.
	- GNU String class objects have been replaced with Standard C++
	  Library string class objects.  This should make the code much more
	  standard and portable.
	- All image I/O operations are handled by a seperate class.
	- Make file has been modified to reflect all code reorganizations and
	  set up to allow future changes easier to make.
	- Seperated all mapping routines from the MaRC front end.  Mapping
	  routines were placed in a library.  A single wrapper class is now
	  used for creation of all types of available maps.
	- Reorganized much of the MaRC front end code and mapping code.
	- Cleaned up code and include file placement.  Template instantiations
	  have been moved to appropriate source files.
	- Added CW and CCW position angle tokens to parser and scanner.
	- Removed IMAGE_TYPE keyword from input file, parser and scanner.
18 January 1997
	- Version number updated to V.0.5.10
	- Replaced queue routines with C++ STL queue routines.
	- Replaced input file parser and scanner with GNU Bison and GNU Flex
	  generated ones.
	- MaRC now accepts more than one input file on the command line.
	- Made various bug fixes in Simple Cylindrical, Orthographic and
	  Input Image routines, mostly involving longitude problems.
	- Replaced coordinate transformation routine with one more suited to
	  the number of rotations.  As a result, a performance increase
	  should be noticeable.
	- MaRC now searches for a ".marc" initialization file.  User defaults
	  may be set in this file, if so desired.
	- Added several keywords to the parser.  "Legal" data ranges may now be
	  specified in the input file or MaRC initialization file.  Also
	  "nibbling" values may be set in either file now.  Output FITS file
	  comments may now be set up via the input file.
	- Mathematical expressions may now be used instead of numbers.  Also,
	  letters may be used to denote hemispheres, some units, etcetera.
	- Replaced older FITS classes with more recent, but experimental, ones
	  in hopes that this would correct a problem with an extra FITS block
	  sometimes showing up between the primary array data and the
	  extension header.
	- Cleaned up some code.  Cleaned up the make file.
	- One line/end of line comments may now be placed in input files
	  without affecting the input file parse process.
	- Added "DATA_OFFSET" and "DATA_SCALE" keywords to allow "BZERO" and
	  "BSCALE" FITS keywords to be used in FITS file.
	- The keywords XSIZE, YSIZE and PHASE are now obsolete.  SAMPLES,
	  LINES and PHASE, respectively, should be used instead.
28 November 1996
	- Version number updated to V.0.5.4
	- Corrected bug in Simple Cylindrical routine involving LO_LON > HI_LON
	- Corrected SIMPLE_C grid creation routine -- related to above problem
	- Orthographic grid creation routine is now working (apparently)
26 November 1996
	- Version number updated to V.0.5.2.
	- Corrected interpolation routine exceptions.
	- Corrected problem when using Arcseconds/pixel to denote scale.
