.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI [ inputfile2... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B marc
is a program designed to produce maps from digital images or from
computed values of incidence, emission or phase angles, and latitudes
and longitudes.  Multi-plane maps can be created with digital image
data in several planes and incidence, emission, phase angles,
latitudes and longitudes in other planes.  Placement of data in a
given plane is completely arbitrary.  The user decides in what plane
to place a given set of data.  Created maps are stored in FITS
(Flexible Image Transport System) format.
